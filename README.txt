This project was done in collaboration.
Abdullah Memon was in charge of Matrix addition and Subtraction.
M. Mubashirullah was in charge of Matrix multiplication.
Abdul Wahab was in charge of Matrix inverse.

Project Lead was Abdul Wahab. He made the repository the rest of us pushed in.
He also made the test client.
Since there were errors in the original download. We made two repositories. This being the updated one.

Design.
We got together and decided to use vectors even though Arrays would have been ideal. 
Since vectors have build in funtion, they were more attractive.

After that we each worked in our own code. Adding the headers in MatrixLib.h and the method bodies in respective .cpp files.
